Frank and Martha are a husband-and-wife team who own and operate a small café business that sells desserts and coffee.
Their daughter, Sofía, and their other employee, Nikhil—who is a secondary school student—also work at the café.
The café has a single location in a large city.
The café currently doesn’t have a marketing strategy. They mostly gain new customers when someone walks by, 
notices the café, and decides to try it. The café has a reputation for high-quality desserts and coffees,
but their reputation is limited to people who have visited, or who have heard about them from their customers.
Sofía suggests to Frank and Martha that they should expand community awareness of what the café has to offer.
The café doesn’t have a web presence yet, and it doesn’t currently use any cloud computing services. However,
that situation is about to change.
